# Using uproot instead of ROOT for Z boson invariant mass notebook

### 1) Opening the exercise with Binder

Run the notebook in Binder.

Just open the badge [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/olaiya/Oxford_zboson-exercise/master)  in the new browser tab to create the Binder environment. When Binder has finished building the interactive environment, it will automatically show the contents of the repository. The exercise can be started by clicking the "uproot_Co-Creation2_ZInvariantMass.ipynb" file in the Binder environment.

If the badge isn't working, you can set the Binder environment manually. Go to <https://mybinder.org/> and paste the URL of this repository (https://github.com/olaiya/Oxford_zboson-exercise/master)
into the field "GitHub repository name or URL". After that click the "launch" button and wait a moment for Binder to create the environment.

Note that the Binder environment is just temporary and will be deleted after you choose to close the exercise.
